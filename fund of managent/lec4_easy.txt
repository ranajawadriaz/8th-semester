ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING TEST:
    Before making a decision, ask yourself:
    
    ✓ Is it LEGAL?
    ✓ Is it FAIR to all stakeholders?
    ✓ Would I be comfortable if it was on the NEWS?
    ✓ Would I be proud to tell my family about it?
    ✓ Does it align with our COMPANY VALUES?
    
    If you answer NO to any of these → RECONSIDER!

================================================================================

□ DECISION-MAKING STYLES:
    □ Linear = Data + Logic
    □ Non-linear = Intuition + Emotions + Experiences
    □ Most managers use BOTH

□ GROUP DECISION MAKING:
    □ Advantages: More info/perspectives, Higher acceptance
    □ Disadvantages: Time-consuming, Risk of groupthink

□ DESIGN THINKING (5 steps):
    1. Empathy
    2. Problem Definition
    3. Idea Generation (Ideation)
    4. Prototyping
    5. Testing

□ BIG DATA:
    □ How it helps: Identifies trends, Predicts behavior, Reduces uncertainty,
                    Improves accuracy
    □ Sources: Customer transactions, Social media, Mobile apps, Market data
    □ Limitations: Privacy, Poor quality data, Needs skilled analysts, 
                   Must be up-to-date

□ THE 12 BIASES (Try to remember at least the names and one-line definitions):
    1. Overconfidence - Think you're better than you are
    2. Immediate Gratification - Want short-term over long-term
    3. Anchoring - Stuck on first information
    4. Selective Perception - Filter out what doesn't fit beliefs
    5. Confirmation - Seek info that confirms pre-conceptions
    6. Framing - Influenced by how info is presented
    7. Availability - Over-emphasize vivid/recent info
    8. Representation - Judge by stereotypes, not statistics
    9. Randomness - See patterns that don't exist
    10. Sunk Cost - Past investments affect future decisions
    11. Self-Serving - Credit for success, blame others for failure
    12. Hindsight - "I knew it all along" (after the fact)

□ ETHICS:
    □ Align with company values and societal norms
    □ Consider ALL stakeholders (not just profits)
    □ Tools: Code of Ethics, Ethical Training
