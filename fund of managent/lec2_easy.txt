MEMORY TRICK FOR MINTZBERG'S ROLES:
    
    INTERPERSONAL: "FLL" = Figurehead, Leader, Liaison
    INFORMATIONAL: "MS" = Monitor, Spokesperson
    DECISIONAL: "ENDR" = Entrepreneur, Negotiator, Disturbance handler, 
                         Resource allocator
    
    Or remember: "People talk, then decide"
    (Interpersonal → Informational → Decisional)

VISUAL SUMMARY - WHO NEEDS WHAT:

                    CONCEPTUAL    HUMAN    TECHNICAL
                    ──────────    ─────    ─────────
    TOP MANAGERS      HIGH        HIGH       LOW
    MIDDLE MANAGERS   MEDIUM      HIGH      MEDIUM
    FIRST-LINE        LOW         HIGH       HIGH
    NON-MANAGERIAL    LOWEST      HIGH      HIGHEST

Think of it like a SEESAW:
    - As you go UP the hierarchy → More CONCEPTUAL, Less TECHNICAL
    - As you go DOWN the hierarchy → Less CONCEPTUAL, More TECHNICAL
    - HUMAN skills stay important throughout!
