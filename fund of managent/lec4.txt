Common Biases & Errors in Decision Making

[cite_start]

Immediate gratification bias: Focus on short-term gain/rewards.   

[cite_start]

Anchoring bias: Relying too heavily on the first piece of info, failing to adjust when new info comes in.   

[cite_start]

Selective Perception bias: Interpreting info in a way that aligns with existing beliefs, filtering what does not fit.   

[cite_start]

Confirmation bias: Searching for or giving weight to info that confirms your pre-conception and rejecting contradictory info.   

[cite_start]

Framing bias: Being influenced by the way info is presented, highlighting and downplaying various aspects.   

[cite_start]

Availability bias: Over-emphasizing info that is vivid, recent, or memorable rather than focusing on reliability/accuracy.   

[cite_start]

Representation bias: Judging the likelihood of an event based on stereotypes rather than critical/statistical data.   

[cite_start]

Randomness bias: Finding patterns that don't exist.   

[cite_start]

Sunk Cost Error: Letting past investments influence continuing something even if the cost is not justified.   

[cite_start]

Self-serving Bias: Taking credit for success but blaming external factors for failures.
