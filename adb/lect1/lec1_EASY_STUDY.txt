================================================================================
📚 PART 1: THE LIBRARY EXAMPLE (SEARCHING & INDEXING)
================================================================================

Think of a database like a LIBRARY with books. Let's understand searching!

SCENARIO:
---------
• Total books (records) = 500,000 books
• Capacity per shelf (block) = 100 books
• Total shelves (blocks) = 5,000 shelves
• Books with title "T" = 250 books

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🔍 CASE 1: NO INDEX + DATA NOT ORDERED (Worst Case!)
----------------------------------------------------
Question: Find all books with title "T"

What happens?
• You have to check EVERY SINGLE SHELF
• This is called LINEAR SEARCH
• Time = Check all 5,000 shelves = 5,000 block reads

WHY IS THIS BAD?
→ Imagine going to every single shelf in a huge library!
→ Super slow! 😫

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🔍 CASE 2: NO INDEX + DATA IS ORDERED (Better!)
-----------------------------------------------
Question: Find all books with title "T"

What happens?
• Books with same title are NEXT TO EACH OTHER (clustered)
• You can use BINARY SEARCH to find the first book
• Time = Log(5000) to find the cluster + 2-3 blocks to read all 250 books

CALCULATION:
• 250 books ÷ 100 per shelf = 3 shelves (approximately)
• Total Time = Log(5000) + 3 ≈ 12 + 3 = 15 block reads!

WHY IS THIS BETTER?
→ Books with title "T" are all on consecutive shelves (co-located)
→ Find one, and the rest are right next to it!

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🔍 CASE 3: NON-CLUSTERED INDEX + DATA NOT ORDERED
-------------------------------------------------
Question: Find all books with title "T"

What is a Non-Clustered Index?
• It's like a CATALOG CARD that tells you WHERE each book is
• But the actual books are scattered everywhere!

What happens?
• Search the index (say it has 10 blocks) = Log(10) ≈ 3 reads
• Get 250 pointers (one for each book with title "T")
• WORST CASE: Each book is on a DIFFERENT shelf = 250 shelf reads!

TOTAL TIME = Log(10) + 250 = 3 + 250 = 253 block reads

WHY IS THIS STILL NOT GREAT?
→ The index helps us FIND the books faster
→ BUT the books are scattered, so we still read many shelves!

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🔍 CASE 4: CLUSTERED INDEX + DATA IS ORDERED (BEST!)
----------------------------------------------------
Question: Find all books with title "T"

What is a Clustered Index?
• It's like having a catalog AND books arranged in order!
• The index points to the FIRST book, and rest are right next to it

What happens?
• Search the index = Log(10) ≈ 3 reads
• Get 1 pointer (to the ANCHOR BLOCK - first shelf with title T)
• Read 3 consecutive shelves for all 250 books

TOTAL TIME = Log(10) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 block reads!!!

WHY IS THIS THE BEST?
→ Index tells us WHERE to start
→ Books are all together (co-located)
→ MINIMUM reads! 🎉

================================================================================
📚 PART 2: INDEX CONCEPTS (SUPER IMPORTANT FOR EXAM!)
================================================================================

🏷️ WHAT IS AN INDEX?
--------------------
Think of it like:
• The INDEX at the back of a textbook
• A phone book directory
• Google search results pointing to websites

An index is a SHORTCUT to find data faster!

🏷️ TWO TYPES OF INDEXES:
-------------------------

1. CLUSTERED INDEX
   • Data is PHYSICALLY ORDERED by the index column
   • Books with same title are on ADJACENT shelves
   • You can only have ONE clustered index per table
   • WHY? Because data can only be sorted ONE way physically!
   
   Example: Library books sorted alphabetically by title
   
2. NON-CLUSTERED INDEX  
   • Data is NOT physically ordered
   • Index has POINTERS to where data is located
   • You can have MULTIPLE non-clustered indexes
   • Books could be anywhere, but catalog tells you where
   
   Example: A separate catalog sorted by author, pointing to book locations

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🏷️ WHEN TO CREATE AN INDEX?
----------------------------

Step 1: Which TABLES need indexes?
• Tables that are FREQUENTLY SEARCHED
• Tables with LOTS OF DATA
• NOT on small tables (overhead not worth it)

Step 2: Which COLUMNS need indexes?
• Columns used in WHERE clauses
• Columns used in JOIN conditions
• Columns used in ORDER BY
• Columns with HIGH SELECTIVITY (many unique values)

Step 3: What TYPE of index?
• B-Tree Index: Most common, good for range queries
• Hash Index: Good for exact matches
• Bitmap Index: Good for columns with few distinct values
• Covered Index: Contains all columns needed for a query

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🏷️ INDEX COSTS (Trade-offs!)
-----------------------------

BENEFITS:
✅ Faster SELECT queries
✅ Faster searching and sorting

COSTS:
❌ STORAGE COST: Index takes up disk space
❌ MAINTENANCE COST: Every INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE must update the index too!

TRADE-OFF RULE:
• If cost is 20% and benefit is 80% → CREATE the index
• If cost is high and benefit is low → DON'T create index

IMPORTANT: Creating wrong indexes can HURT performance!
          (Backfire - slower than no index!)

📚 PART 4: KEY FORMULAS & QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

🔢 BLOCKING FACTOR (bfr)
------------------------
• How many records fit in one block
• bfr = Block Size / Record Size

🔢 SELECTIVITY
--------------
• Number of records that match a search condition
• Example: 250 books with title "T" → Selectivity = 250

🔢 SEARCH COSTS
---------------
Linear Search (no index, not ordered):
    Cost = Total Number of Blocks

Binary Search (ordered, no index):
    Cost = Log₂(Number of Blocks) + (Selectivity / bfr)

Index Search (with index):
    Cost = Log₂(Index Blocks) + Access Cost
    
    Where Access Cost depends on:
    • Clustered: Selectivity / bfr (few blocks)
    • Non-Clustered: Selectivity (each record may be on different block)

================================================================================
🎯 EXAM TIPS FOR LECTURE 1
================================================================================

1. KNOW THE DIFFERENCE between Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index
   • Clustered = Data physically sorted = ONE per table
   • Non-Clustered = Pointers to data = MANY per table

2. UNDERSTAND the trade-offs of creating indexes
   • Benefit = Faster reads
   • Cost = Storage + Maintenance

3. BE ABLE TO CALCULATE search costs for different scenarios
   • Linear search = N blocks
   • Binary search = Log(N) blocks
   • Index search = Log(Index size) + access blocks

4. KNOW WHEN to create an index
   • Frequently searched columns
   • High selectivity columns
   • Not on small tables

================================================================================
✅ QUICK MEMORY TRICKS
================================================================================

"CLUSTERED = CLOSE TOGETHER" 
    → Data with same key is physically next to each other

"NON-CLUSTERED = SCATTERED WITH A MAP"
    → Data is scattered, index is the map with pointers

"INDEX = SHORTCUT"
    → Faster to find, but costs to maintain

"LOG = DIVIDE AND CONQUER"
    → Binary search halves the search space each time

================================================================================
                    💪 YOU GOT THIS! GOOD LUCK! 💪
