p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

CSS Selector
The CSS element Selector

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 
#para1 {

Margins and Paddings
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
margin: 25px;
margin-top: 10px;
margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top margin is 25px - right margin is 50px - bottom margin is 75px - left margin is 100px
Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
padding: 25px;
padding-top: 10px;
padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top padding is 25px - right padding is 50px - bottom padding is 75px - left padding is 100px

MARGIN - PADDING 
div {
  padding: 10px 20px;
}
This means:
Top = 10px
Bottom = 10px
Left = 20px
Right = 20px

div {
  padding: 10px 20px 30px;
}
This means:
Top = 10px
Left = 20px
Right = 20px
Bottom = 30px

19

Anchor style
a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

a:link {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
  border: 2px solid green;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
}

Specificity

Specificity measure which css rule to apply when multiple css rules target the same styling property of an element, i.e.,

21

Specificity
The more specific the selector, the higher the priority. The order of priority is as follows (first one has the highest priority)
html style attribute
id
class
element selector
22

CSS Cascade
If two CSS rules have the same specificity, the browser determines which rule to apply using the following criteria:
Internal vs. External CSS: Rules defined in internal (embedded) CSS take precedence over rules in external CSS if they have the same specificity.
Order of Appearance: When two rules are in the same location (both in internal CSS or both in external CSS), the rule that appears later in the code will be applied.
23

Precedence	
If the same css rule is being applied in more than one way, then the following order of precedence is followed:
inline css ( html style attribute)
internal/embedded css
external css
Note: A css rule with !important always takes precedence.

EXAMPLE CODE:
 background-color: red !important;

24

BOX MODEL
The box model defines the different parts of that shape, which are broken up into four pieces, or sub-boxes:
Content: the inner content of your HTML element.
Padding: a box that surrounds an HTML element's inner content. In the image below, it's the extra space around the content that also shares the background;.

Border: a box that surrounds an HTML element's padding. In the image below, it's the darker space around the padding: 

Margin: a functionally invisible box that surrounds an HTML element's border. The margin is meant to act as white space to separate HTML elements from each other. In the image below, it's the white spaces between and around the two paragraphs:
25

Primarily two types of display: block and inline
Block level elements are formatted visually as blocks / boxes (e.g. Paragraphs) – vertically stacked
Blocks may further contain other blocks or inline elements
Inline content is distributed in form of lines and does not introduce a new block content – horizontally aligned
display:none doesn't display element at all
display: block
display: list-item
display: table

display: inline
display: inline-block
display: inline-table

Block level
Inline level
Display

Class Test
HTML & CSS Test

A big header text with a title (e.g., "My Simple Web Page").
A main section with at least one paragraph and an image.

Part 2: CSS
Write a CSS stylesheet that styles your HTML page. Include the following styles:
